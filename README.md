# Contribution Guidelines
## Directory Management
All scene files should go in ``res://scenes``
Do not move files without discussing with the team first! While it can be helpful, this can also cause issues with Git.

## Commits
1. Create a new branch from the main branch.
	- Also make sure to communicate what scene files you're working on!
	- If two commits edit the same file simultaenously, it will cause a merge conflict (and a huge headache)
2. After making your changes, make sure to test the game and make sure everything is still working.
3. When ready to merge to main, create a pull request.
	- This will run a series of tests.
	- If a test fails, something is wrong with the files! Check and try to fix.
	- Don't be afraid to let the team know if you're having issues!
4. Notify someone for code review. Your part is done here!
	- If you're reviewing, make sure everything you see is good and can be understood.
	- Select ``approve`` when you leave your comment if you think everything is good.
	- Once approved, the reviewer can merge.
