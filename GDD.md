## Target Audience


# Concept
## Gameplay Overview
Navigate the overworld, armed with the Potion Launcher.
The overworld is made up of multiple rooms. When player enters a new room, the room is shrouded in SHADOW (room is grayscale), and filled with SHADOW creatures.
The ALCHEMIST must purify the room without hurting the SHADOW CREATURES, by getting to the SUNflowers (colored).
Upon reaching enough SUNflowers, the ALCHEMIST's SUNSPARK activates, purifying the room and every SHADOW creatures within it.

## Theme Interpretations
Shadow: SHADOW has descended upon the world. Player attempts to restore the sun to banish the SHADOW.

Alchemy: Player is an ALCHEMIST, who collects reagents and brews new potions that interact with the environment to address challenges. 

## Primary Mechanics
* Turn cycle: Player makes 1 action, all the NPCs make 1 action each
* Player is armed with potion gun, with a bunch of different options depending on what they unlocked so far
* Each shadow has a small moveset, and they tell you in advance what they will do (i.e. Into the Breach)
* Players must get to 3 out of 5 SUNflowers to extract the latent energy of the SUN and purify the room. This restores color to the room and you can now safely explore.
* (There should be some sort of turn timer. Refer to Issue 16 for discussion.)

### Potion Launcher

* Alchemist's Fire: ranged attack in a line, knocks back and Stun 1 first enemy hit. (Stun X: prevent next X turns of the hit enemy)
