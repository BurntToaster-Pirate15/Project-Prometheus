## Target Audience


# Concept
## Gameplay Overview
Navigate the overworld, armed with the Potion Launcher.
The overworld is made up of multiple rooms. When player enters a new room, the room is shrouded in SHADOW (room is grayscale), and filled with SHADOW creatures.
The ALCHEMIST must purify the room without hurting the SHADOW CREATURES, by getting to the SUNflowers (colored).
Upon reaching enough SUNflowers, the ALCHEMIST's SUNSPARK activates, purifying the room and every SHADOW creatures within it.

## Theme Interpretations
ALCHEMY brought prosperity to humankind, but at the cost of gradually corrupting our surroundings.
First, it was the AIR. Air was filled with alchemical fumes, and soon, people couldn't breathe the air without protection, also made through ALCHEMY.
Next, it was the WATER. Not even the cleansing nature of WATER could wash away all the corruptive fumes. ALCHEMISTS made distilleries to try to purify the WATER.
Then, it was the EARTH. The WATER carried its corruption into the EARTH, and soon the soil grew sour. ALCHEMISTS still tried to fix the EARTH with more ALCHEMY.
And finally, it was the FIRE. The SUN itself was swallowed by the SHADOWS and shattered. The SUNSPARKS scattered around the world, carrying what little strength remains of the SUN.
It wasn't just you who made this happen, but you were one of the ALCHEMISTS. With a shard of SUNSPARK in protected by ALCHEMY, you venture out to collect the SUNSPARKS and restore the SUN...

## Primary Mechanics
* Turn cycle: Player makes 1 action, all the NPCs make 1 action each
* Player is armed with potion gun, with a bunch of different options depending on what they unlocked so far
* Each shadow has a small moveset, and they tell you in advance what they will do (i.e. Into the Breach)
* Players must get to 3 out of 5 SUNflowers to extract the latent energy of the SUN and purify the room. This restores color to the room and you can now safely explore.
* (There should be some sort of turn timer. Refer to Issue 16 for discussion.)

## Music
* There are 3 songs that play through the game, one for the title screen, one for the boss, and one for general gameplay and ambiance
* Since the game is a darker adventure an epic and sinister sound was used in the title screen to grab the players attention from the start and get them immersed.
* Every good boss fight is a mixture of intensity, doubt, and epicness, which is what the song tries to capture. The desperate attemps of the valiant hero fighting against all odds
* For the gameplay track a mystical and relaxed song was made. The focus should be on the game, so a lighter song that makes the player feel like they are in a different world was the idea.
